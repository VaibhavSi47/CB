  utter_distancing:
  - text: Social distancing is a public health practice that aims to prevent sick people from coming in close contact with healthy people in order to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. It can include large-scale measures like canceling group events or closing public spaces, as well as individual decisions such as avoiding crowds.
  utter_spread:
  - text: 'To prevent the spread of COVID-19: Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible. Don‚Äôt touch your eyes, nose or mouth. Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.'
  utter_spread_2:
  - text: "The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated
             through coughing and sneezing). Individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces
             contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The COVID-19 virus may
             survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it"

  utter_vulnerable:
  - text: "We are learning more about how COVID-19 affects people every day. Older people, and people with
             chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease,appear to be more at risk of developing
             severe symptoms. As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children. We know it is
             possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there are relatively few cases of
             COVID-19 reported among children. This is a new virus and we need to learn more about how it affects
             children. The virus can be fatal in rare cases, so far mainly among older people with pre-existing medical
             conditions."

  utter_decision:
  - text: "Based on the symptoms you shared with us, it's unlikely you have a COVID 19 infection.
             However, you must maintain social distancing and regularly wash your hands and sanitize them.
             #Stayhome. #Staysafe üôÇ"
  utter_decision_2:
  - text: "Based on the symptoms you shared with us, we would recommend you to visit the nearest COVID center for testing.Make sure you don't come in close contact with your friends and family."

  utter_decision_3:
  - text: "Based on the symptoms you shared with us, we would recommend you to consult to a doctor.
               However, you must maintain social distancing and regularly wash your hands and sanitize them.

  utter_covid_info:
  - text: COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‚Äòviral pneumonia‚Äô in Wuhan, People‚Äôs Republic of China.
  utter_covid_people:
  - text: Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care. Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys. In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.
